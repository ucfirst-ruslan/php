Determine whether a variable is considered to be empty.
A variable is considered empty if it does not exist or
if its value equals FALSE. empty() does not generate
a warning if the variable does not exist.
No warning is generated if the variable does not exist.
That means empty() is essentially the concise
equivalent to !isset($var) || $var == false
